# BibParser.jl

BibParser is a Julia package for parsing different bibliographic formats. The output are entries following the BibInternal.jl srtuctures.

Currently, only a BibTeX parser is available.

This package is not meant to be used on its own. Please check [Bibliography.jl]([https://](https://github.com/Azzaare/Bibliography.jl)) for a package handling both import/export from various bibliographic formats.
